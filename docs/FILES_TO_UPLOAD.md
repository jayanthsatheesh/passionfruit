```

## SKIP These Files/Folders:
```
attached_assets/      ← Large demo files (GitHub file size limits)
.env                  ← Secrets (use GitHub repository secrets instead)
.replit               ← Replit-specific config
index.html            ← Root HTML (Vite uses client/index.html)
node_modules/         ← Dependencies (installed by GitHub Actions)
dist/                 ← Build output (generated by GitHub Actions)
```

## Why Skip attached_assets?
- Contains large demo files and mockups
- Not needed for the live website
- GitHub has file size limits
- Your actual product images are served from URLs in the CSV

## Upload Process:
1. Download project from Replit
2. Create new GitHub repository
3. Upload only the files listed in "Include" section above
4. Add EmailJS secrets in repository settings
5. Push to main branch - automatic deployment starts
